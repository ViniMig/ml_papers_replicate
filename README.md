# ml_papers_replicate
Trying to read and replicate relevant or new ML papers as I learn.

Want to gain knowledge in Machine Learning through reading papers and trying to replicate the code whenever possible. This will allow me to better understand the papers and also to practice developing, especially using frameworks, in this case **Pytorch**.
Currently working on the most famous and probably important paper to date, the Transformers paper by *Vaswani et al, 2017, "Attention is all you need"*.
