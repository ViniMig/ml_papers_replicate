# ml_papers_replicate
Trying to read and replicate relevant or new ML papers as I learn.

As I look to gain knowledge in Machine Learning through reading papers and trying to replicate the code whenever possible, also thought "why not put it on github?". This will allow me to better understand the papers and also to practice developing, especially using frameworks, in this case **Pytorch**.

# First paper - The Transformers paper, of course!
Currently working on the most famous and, probably, important paper to date: the Transformers paper by *[Vaswani et al, 2017, "Attention is all you need"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)*.<br>
Toughest part will be not having the resources to actually train the model exactly as described in the paper, but will get back to it eventually.
